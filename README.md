# Scraping Hotel Review Data from Trip Advisor

This project is attached to my project for Machine Learning, in which I will build a classifier to classify hotel reviews.  However, the hard part for classifying hotel reviews, is getting a training set of hotel reviews!  This is why Iâ€™ve decided to do this project in Unix Tools, to scrape reviews from TripAdvisor pages on the internet, to gather reviews in an efficient way.

The way that I was doing this previously was using [import.io](https://www.import.io/), a website that allows for scraping of data for machine learning purposes.  However, with the trial version I was using, it only allowed 500 queries per account, and I had to keep making new trial accounts to get all the data I needed.  To remedy this, my goal is to download the HTML for each webpage, and extract the data using Unix Tools, sanitizing the data as much as I can, so that I can input the data into my machine learning project.

### Process
First, I extracted the general place the data resides on the webpage, by finding the specific `<div>`(s) that the reviews are located in.

`cat FILENAME_HERE.html | tr -d "\r\n" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | egrep -o "<div class=\"listcontainer.hide-more-mobile.*<a data-page-number=\"[0-9]*\".*data-offset=\"[0-9]*\"class=\"pagenum last[^<]*</a></div></div><[^>]*><[^>]*>"`

- `tr -d "\r\n"` removes the return and newline characters in the file
- `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` changes all uppercase characters to lowercase.  This *should* work for any UTF-8 language.
- the `egrep` call isolates the specific div where the reviews lie

So far, this isolates the specific div where each of the 5 reviews lie.  Now, I have to grab the **review text** as well as the **rating**.  Luckily, these are the only things I need for the purpose of machine learning.

### Grabbing the Review Text
`Not working yet`

 `egrep -o "<p class=\"partial_entry\"[^<]*<p>"`
 What I want this to do is to grab the whole `<p></p>` block but it doesn't work because it stops at any HTML tag within that block.  There are some <scan> tags, so this doesn't work too well.

TODO: Finish the process
